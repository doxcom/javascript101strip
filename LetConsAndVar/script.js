//let const and var

let age = 30;
//we can change to another one
age = 31; //in another point in the code, re assigning value
//is a good case to use let
//or if you want to declare empty variables:
let age_example_variable;


//value in a const cant change

const birthYear = 1990;
//also must be initialize
//const job; //is not allowed

//in old code is use var to declare variables

var job_john = 'programmer';
job_john = 'teacher'
//can be changed
